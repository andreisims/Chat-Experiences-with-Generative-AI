# Transforming Chat Experiences with Generative AI

Have you ever been frustrated by a chatbot that just didn’t get it? You’re not alone. Traditional chatbots often rely on rigid workflows, designed to handle only specific pre-programmed scenarios. Venture beyond their scripted boundaries, and you’re met with unhelpful, canned responses.

But things have changed. Generative AI has redefined what’s possible in chatbot technology. By leveraging advanced models that can generate text, images, and media, we can now create chat experiences that are smarter, more adaptable, and feel genuinely human.

In this session, we’ll dive into building a cutting-edge generative AI chat assistant powered by Foundation Models on Amazon Bedrock. Get ready to revolutionize how you engage with chat technology!
